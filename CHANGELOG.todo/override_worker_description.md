## Added
### Ability to override worker description per batch
When starting a `gspc::scoped_runtime_system` one traditionally
specifies a `topology_description` for the workers, which is reused
for any `add_worker()` call. An overload has been added that allows
giving a specific description per call, in order to allow asymmetric
topologies.
