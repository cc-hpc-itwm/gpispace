## Removed
### Orchestrator was inlined into Agent
The `orchestrator` process has been removed and the functionality was
moved into `agent`. This has also removed the `--orchestrator-port`
command line option.

Due to removing this level, log messages may slightly differ. Besides
that post-job cleanup scripts should be adopted to no longer try to
kill `orchestrator`.
