run_nightly

This is the shell script which is started on build_<xxx> as a cron job for the
nightly builds. Mainly it sets up the environment and then calls the ctest
script which drives the actual Nightly.


SDPANightly.cmake

This is the ctest script which drives the Nightly build on build_<xxx>. It probably
works only on build_<xxx>, since it relies on the directory layout, the location of
Qt and other things.


chrpath.cmake

This is a cmake script which can be used to modify the RPATH of an existing
ELF file. It needs -DFILE=<filename> and -DRPATH=<new rpath>.
