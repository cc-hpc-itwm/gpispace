        //! * a ctor of std::error_code (the c++11/14 exposition only one)
        //! In c++11/14 there is no standard-compliant way to
        //! construct a std::future_error. Most implementations either
        //! backported the c++17 way or offer an actually exposition
        //! only constructor taking a std::error_code, but not
        //! offering it is still a valid implementation. You will
        //! likely have to look into the future_error implementation
        //! to see if there is another constructor that can be used,
        //! or we can't use this STL implementation.

        //! \note a std::future_errc is implicitly convertible to a
        //! std::error_code, so the actual compatibilty magic is to
        //! always call it with a std::future_errc rather than an
        //! std::error_code in the make_future_error overload
        //! above. Yes, this is an additional category check if we
        //! would have the std::error_code ctor, but is easier to read
        //! code and avoids a compiler detection, and also highlights
        //! the issue that future_error::code() returns something that
        //! can't be used for constructing future_error, even in
        //! c++17.
