# Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to GPI-Space, from writing GPI-Space
applications to suggestions on improving the documentation. Also,
writing code that can be incorporated into the source tree. Even by
simply providing suggestions on how we can improve GPI-Space and help
spread the word are great ways to contribute and make GPI-Space
better.

## How to Cite

For referencing GPI-Space in publications, please use the following BibTeX entry.

```
@misc {GSPC,
  author = {Fraunhofer ITWM, Competence Center High Performance Computing},
  title = {GPI-Space},
  year = {2020},
  month = {September},
  howpublished = {https://www.gpi-space.de},
}
```

## How to Contribute

For contributions other than modifications of the source code, as for
example the suggestion of a feature or enhancement, you can use the
existing ticketing system from the Fraunhofer ITWM. Just drop us an
email at gpispace-support@itwm.fraunhofer.de. Otherwise, using Github
issues is also an alternative.

For modifications in the source tree we kindly ask you to sign a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Again, just contact us at
gpispace-support@itwm.fraunhofer.de and we will contact you and send
you the CLA. Having that, just send a pull request with the changes.

least the following points:

- What version are you using
