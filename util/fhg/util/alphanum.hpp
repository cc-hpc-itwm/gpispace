        /* Based on http://www.davekoelle.com/files/alphanum.hpp
           The Alphanum Algorithm is an improved sorting algorithm for strings
           containing numbers.  Instead of sorting numbers in ASCII order like a
           standard sort, this algorithm sorts numbers in numeric order.

           The Alphanum Algorithm is discussed at http://www.DaveKoelle.com

           compare l and r with strcmp() semantics, but using
           the "Alphanum Algorithm". This function is designed to read
           through the l and r strings only one time, for
           maximum performance. It does not allocate memory for
           substrings. It can either use the C-library functions isdigit()
           and atoi() to honour your locale settings, when recognizing
           digit characters when you "#define ALPHANUM_LOCALE=1" or use
           it's own digit character handling which only works with ASCII
           digit characters, but provides better performance.
