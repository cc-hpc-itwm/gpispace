situation/goal: process a file in parallel (no vmem, just multiple calcs working on a subrange of the input file)

run:
  make
  make -C src
  ./src/gen.bin > dat #### todo: defaults!
  make run
output:
  same as from gen.bin?

how:
* get total size
* produce size/blocksize work packages with offset + size
* calc (package) -> partial_result
* reduce (partial_result, state) -> state, counting remaining packages
* terminate if remaining packages = 0

todo: simplify calc, not loading threaded?
todo: simplify config, having size_chunk == size_buffer? different sizes don't seem to make much sense anyhow
todo: execution hangs if file data could not be opened.
todo: defaults in makefile are different from defaults for generator
