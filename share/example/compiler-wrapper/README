= `share/examples/compiler-wrapper`: Wraps calls to a compiler within a workflow to easily compile a large project in a distributed fashion.

== Situation

This example demonstrates how one can wrap a compiler within GPISpace and use the runtime system to distribute the compilation jobs to several hosts. Suppose you have a large project that you want to compile using `make` and some compiler (e.g. `gcc`). On a single host, you only have a limited number of cores available to run the compilation in parallel - but what if you have a whole cluster or a bunch of host at hand that you may use as well? There are other tools available that do basically the same (i.e. distcc, icecream) as this simple wrapper but have to be installed separately and can only do this task.

== Compiling the example `compiler-wrapper`

A copy of this example can be found in `$GSPC_HOME/share/example/compiler-wrapper`.

You have to load GPI-Space into your environment so that the development tools are available.

In order to compile and run the example one should use the provided `link:Makefile[]`.

First step is to create a (temporary) folder where to build the example and to keep the intermediarily generated files.

== Cleaning the generated files 
Erasing all the files and data generated during the compilation can be done by invoking the command:

...
$ make clean BUILDDIR=$HOME/build
...
