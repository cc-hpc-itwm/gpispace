  # there is no dependency between the actual target we find here and
  # successors. Hopefully there are no common dependencies with
  # different paths.
  # \note These are always required as it is only used if the package
  # was found and needs a dependency. If the package exists but a
  # dependency does not, that's an unexpected and broken environment.
  # \todo This is dangerous and may lead to linking a shared and
  # static version of such a common dependency at the same time! It is
  # unclear how to solve this without controlling all find_package
