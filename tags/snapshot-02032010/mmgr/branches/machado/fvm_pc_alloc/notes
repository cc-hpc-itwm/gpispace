-lots of repeated code
-- put local and global alloc/free as one function

- logging mechanism should be improved (when integrating with other
components)


 TODO: 
- how to run the pc on all nodes -> always get this error because of not being able to load module

 - check the returns of functions everywhere and terminate gracefully 
 - do performance measurements  
 - tests for different situations 
 - try to remove some global state things where possible 
 - think about multi-threaded requests without serializing requests (work queue for thread allocator?) 
 - more fault tolerance 


- having an intermediate copy to a scratch space sucks. How can we change this?

- if something goes wrong, fvm stops and everything hangs

- cant load module on other nodes (compiler, env dependency)
sucks:

- to call a function from a module, we need to iterate over it....?

- can't compile against -std=c99 with gcc
- get segfault on tests with gcc
