Thanks to the efforts of our development team, the much-anticipated open source release of GPI-Space is finally here.

After careful evaluation of software licenses from third party dependencies and applications using GPI-Space, the ultimate decision was made for the third version of the Gnu General Public License (i.e. GNU GPLv3 or GPLv3).
This allows GPI-Space to be used free of charge in most research and private project scenarios.
The move towards GPLv3 also allowed to dual-license GPI-Space under a commercial license to address the cases where it is not possible to use copyleft licensed software.
