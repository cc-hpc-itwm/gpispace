## New Example and Documentation for Scheduling with Preferences

The feature `Scheduling with Preferences and Multi-Modules` has been in GPI-Space since quite a while with version 21.12 releasing the first version documenting it.
This release improves on the existing documentation and enhances it with a standalone example.

## Fixes

- Fixed a -Wstringop-overflow warning in the gspc-monitor with GCC 11.
- Disabling -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings in GPI-Space due to compilation problems in the DRTS kernel caused by false positives.
- Missing includes in the `ostream_redirect` logger tests were causing compilation failures with GCC 12.1.
- HWLOC with version >= 2.5.0 is injecting the environment variable `ZES_ENABLE_SYSMAN` at runtime causing the `worker_env` test to fail, hence the test has been deactivated if GPI-Space is compiled with one of these HWLOC versions.

## Miscellaneous

- The GPI-Space code base underwent some minor refactoring using clang-tidy to increase the overall code quality.
- The use of fhg::util::latch within tests was replaced with std::promise for better code maintainability.
