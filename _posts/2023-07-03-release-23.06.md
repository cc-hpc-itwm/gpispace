## CMake Minimum Version Upgrade

The minimum required version of CMake was bumped from `3.15` to `3.16`.
Starting with this version, CMake supports zero padded version numbers (e.g. 23.06) allowing the removal of some buggy CMake code from GPI-Space.

## Fixes

- Changed the copyright notice in source files to the more compact SPDX standard.
- Removed the deprecated use of `std::unary_function`.

## Miscellaneous

- Removed the install instructions for GPI-Space dependencies.
  Dependencies can directly be installed through the Spack package manager instead.
  The removed instructions are still available through old versions of GPI-Space on the website.
