Setting up GPI-Space on a system just became easier.
An installattion is now a single command.
With a working `Spack` installation (see [Spack - Getting Started](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)) the only thing left to do is:

```bash
spack install gpi-space
```

For more information on `Spack` have a look at their [official documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
