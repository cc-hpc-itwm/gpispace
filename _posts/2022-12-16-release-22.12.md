## GPI-2 Minimum Version Upgrade

## Fixes

- GPI-Space builds and installations will no longer contain the `git.submodules` file.
  This means that GPI-Space applications no longer need to set the `DO_NOT_CHECK_GIT_SUBMODULES` or
  `ALLOW_DIFFERENT_GIT_SUBMODULES` components in their `find_package (GPISpace)` calls.
- Remove the Hardcoded Device-ID Limitation in IML's NetdevID Wrapper.

  > **NOTE:**
  >
  > `GPI-2` still has a limitation which will trigger an error if the `gaspi_config_t` is set to an
  > invalid value.

- Fixes the broken GSPC_WITH_IML CXXFLAG for Boost Versions <1.63.0.
  Previously the GSPC_WITH_IML CXXFLAG was not appended when GPI-Space was compiled with Boost versions 1.62.0 or smaller.
