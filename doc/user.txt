Overview
--------

GPI-Space is a system to develop and execute cluster applications. The
main focus of GPI-Space is to separate communication and coordination.
(see <<gelernter:1992>>)

This manual is written for users that want to implement applications
within GPI-Space.

GPI-Space consists of three main components:

* the distributed runtime system,
* the workflow engine and
* the virtual memory layer.

Installation
------------

To install GPI-Space just unpack the distribution file:

[source,bash]
cd $HOME
tar xvzf gpispace.tgz

and add `$HOME/gpispace/bin` to your serch path:

[source,bash]
export PATH=$HOME/gpispace/bin:$PATH

To test the installation run

[source,bash]
gspc selftest

When GPI-Space is installed correctly the output will be something
like

----
GPI-Space selftest started...
test FOO: OKAY
test BAR: OKAY
GPI-Space selftest completed: 0 error(s)

Workflows
---------

=== Small example (predefined)
=== Submit
=== Extract results
=== Workflow description language
==== Place, Token, Transition, Port, Type
==== Simple networks
==== Expressions
==== Conditions

Use conditions to make the activation of a transition depend on the
input token(s). Conditions are boolean expressions that are evaluated until an
avtivating combination of input tokens is found, that is a combination
that evaluates to `true`.

For example, the transition `collatz_even`

[source,xml]
<transition name="collatz_even">
  <defun>
    <in name="a" type="unsigned long"/>
    <out name="f" type="unsigned long"/>
    <expression>
      ${f} := ${a} div 2UL
    </expression>
    <condition>
      ${a} mod 2UL :eq: 0UL
    </condition>
  </defun>
  <connect-in port="a" place="a"/>
  <connect-out port="f" place="f"/>
</transition>

is activated only for even values on place `a`.

NOTE: Let 'T' be a transition with input places 'p~1~,...,p~n~' and
let 'k~i~' be the number of tokens on the place 'p~i~'. Let 'c' be the
condition attached to 'T'. Then 'c' gets evaluated at most
'k~1~ · k~2~ ·...· k~n~' times, that is the product of the number of
tokens on each input place.

Conditions can be attached either to transitions or to functions. The
code above is equivalent to

[source,xml]
----
<defun name="half">
  <in name="a" type="unsigned long"/>
  <out name="f" type="unsigned long"/>
  <expression>
    ${f} := ${a} div 2UL
  </expression>
</defun>

<transition name="collatz_even">
  <use name="half"/>
  <condition>
    ${a} mod 2UL :eq: 0UL
  </condition>
  <connect-in port="a" place="a"/>
  <connect-out port="f" place="f"/>
</transition>

Glossary
--------

DRTS:: Distributed runtime system.

Place:: In a Petri net: Placeholder for meta data, drawn as a
  circle. Each place has a type and cannot contain token of another
  type.

Token:: In a Petri net: The representation of meta data, typically
  drawn as a small circle. The meta data has a type.

Transition:: In a Petri net: Placeholder for an action, drawn as a
   rectangle. If all input places contain at least one token, then the
   transition is 'enabled' and can 'fire'. A transition that fires
   consumes one token from each input place and produces one token on
   each output place.

Petri net:: A bipartite directed graph. The members of the two node
  sets are called places and transitions.
