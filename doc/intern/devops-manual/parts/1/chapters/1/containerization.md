# Containerization

The goal of containerization is to obtain reproducible software environments to build, run, and easily share applications.
There are several container solutions available at this point in time, but this document focuses only on two of them.
Docker, for its popularity and widespread support, and Singularity, for its security features and support for HPC environments.
