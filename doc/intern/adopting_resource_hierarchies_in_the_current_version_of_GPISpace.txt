Initial sketch summarizing some ideas from the first discussion
about adopting resource hierarchies in the current GPI-Space version.

1) A Resource Manager will be added to the agent.
2) This Resource Manager will use the Forest data structure type
   from the prototype.
3) The user starts the runtime system with a Forest that is 
   sent to the top-level agent for initializing the Resource Manager.
4) In case no explicit forest is provided by the user, the Resource Manager
   will be initialized with a forest consisting of single cores.
5) The worker topology description is kept as it is for the moment. 
6) Since the agent is spawned before the workers, it is ensured at worker registration
   time that the Resource Manager is already initialized with all resources.
7) The Scheduler acquires/releases resources from/to the Resource Manager
   before starting or after finishing tasks. Acquiring resources can be done 
   at assignment time or at the task starting time (when using pre-assignment,
   as the situation currently is).
8) Ignore for now the possible defragmentation issues related to releasing
   non-deterministically the resources.
   
To do next:
1) Take a closer look at the structure data types in the prototype and figure out 
   how to integrate them in the production version (Forest, Resource, etc);
2) Investigate/assess the impact/modifications to be done on/in other GPI-Space components
3) Investigate/assess the impact/modifications that should be done in the tests
