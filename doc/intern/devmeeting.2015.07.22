## Goals:

* aloma
  - Demo at SEG2015 in October -> to be definied by Norman
  - Demo at RSI in Houston any time (please do not remove Hpcdemo account)
    - extension: prepare tutorial on how to include a new algorithm (Dirk)
  - speichermanagement (key) -> generator + gpi-space
    (effort not yet known, all together certainly 3-4 month)
     - in-memory operationen
  - batch mode (key) (Bernd, prototype util Sep 7th)

  - support for more types of algorithms -> generator
    (effort not yet known, all together certainly 2-3 month)
    - stencil
    - different sizes for different inputs
    - multiple input in one transition
    - output larger than input
    - automatic coercion
    - different granularity of input in one transition
  - Datentypen -> generator + pdl + data management
  - store _and_ process intermediate results -> generator
  - Selektion von Daten (lazy? eager? both?)
  - Drag&Drop fÃ¼r mehr als ein Datum -> remote adoption
  - Installation/Parametrisierung

* frtm
  - rework job management server, parallel execution, persistent
    state, add/remove for individual or groups, status of worker
  - release before aug 7th, command line level
  - workflow improvements -> scalability, get_shots eager(?)
  - cancel policy -> kill on cancel in gpispace
  - on_cancel im interface
  - gpi-space robust, e.g. when all workers get killed by -9 or crash _no_
    message whatsoever appears, _no_ information at all to the job
    server
  - rework interface -> discuss with acceleware
  - test GPU support?

* splotch?
   - use more than 128 nodes -> gpispace lazy connect -> test
   - selftest
   - job server
   - support for multiple snapshots plus interpolation

* enauto? -> within 3 years of project duration
   - define interface for bunch of applications
     - physics
     - life science
  - implement workflows
  - implement starter binaries
  - improve scheduler: support for time-to-solution/energy-to-solution

* gpispace
  - topology management (4-6 month)
  - memory management (4-6 month)
  - scheduler steals work (4 weeks)
  - deployment
     - machine spec, e.g. disk less?
  - network proxy?  (low)
  - interruption handling
  - progress report
  - course
  - remove orchestrator, alternative: make it useful, e.g. let it be a
    generic job management server
  - static typecheck

* Kurs -> Jens K.

## Work:

- Tiberiu: --24.7 || 26.8--
- Mirko: --7.8 || 7.9--
- Bernd: probably away two or three weeks

Tiberiu:
  - propose changes that are required to support
    performance models -> until Sep 7th
  - implements work stealing -> until Sep 7th

Mirko: FRTM/SPLOTCH until Aug 7th
           (including gpispace changes)
           write down constraints for aloma modules

Bernd:
  - network bug
  - write down constraints for aloma modules
  - gpispace player (including cmake bundle call)
  - aloma batch mode for a single job (minimal invasive, require build
    infrastructure, produce tree with executable and most parameters
    bind)
 - support extended status with live information about
   worker status (e.g. kill -0 from rifd works == answered
   within a certain amount of time)
