situation/goal: work_and_wait_credit + how many packages total known in work

run: make run
output:
### work 0 of [0..12)
credit 0
config Struct [description := "test"]
### work 1 of [0..12)
credit 1
config Struct [description := "test"]
### work 2 of [0..12)
credit 2
config Struct [description := "test"]
### work 3 of [0..12)
credit 3
config Struct [description := "test"]
### work 4 of [0..12)
credit 0
config Struct [description := "test"]
### work 5 of [0..12)

credit 2
config Struct [description := "test"]

how: add port+place, add virtual place in work, add place-map in transition, read from virtual place in work (don't consume!)

todo: why also use a templated work.xpnet?
todo: strip output, but which part? simplify output to only be one line per work?
