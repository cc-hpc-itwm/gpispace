situation/goal: subnets observing state in the net they are included in: subnet waits for a given number of tokens which are produced on a place in the parent net, then outputs done-token

run:
  $ make run
  WORK 0
  WORK 1
  WORK 2
  WORK 3
  WORK 4
  finished [1]
  done => []

how: add place in subnet, mark as virtual, add tunnel to that place. use place like normal place in subnet, connecting to counting-transition. include subnet in net, add place-map to tell subnet the place it should observe.

note: be sure to know when to consume from virtual places. debugging may be a pain if multiple nets access the same place and wildly consume (and not put back) the token.
